# Java-Age-of-War
My simplified java implementation of famous flash game Age of War. 
Game UI is in polish.
If there is an error like
```
input == null
```
in your compiler check if "grafiki" folder is in "out/production/JavaAgeOfWar/game" directory, if not copy it there.
### To run game compile GameTest through IntelliJ.
