# Java-Age-of-War
My simplified java implementation of famous flash game Age of War. 
Game UI is in polish.
To run game compile GameTest through IntelliJ.
If there is an error like "input == null" in your compiler check if "grafiki" folder is in "out/production/JavaAgeOfWar/game" directory, if not copy it there.
